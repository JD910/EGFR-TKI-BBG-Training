# EGFR-TKI-BBG-Training
This is the source code of large-scale bi-directional generative adversarial network (BigBiGAN) for deep learning semantic feature extraction.

Using the "HDF5_File_Create.py" to create the training, validation, and test file for BigBiGAN training. 

The "EGFR-TKI-BBG-Training.ipynb" should be running on the free Google Colab platform.

We set epoch = 200 and batch_size = 20 when using the Google Colab GPU.
